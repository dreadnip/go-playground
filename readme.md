# Go-playground

This is a repo for me to screw around in with Go. The stuff in here right now is the product of [this tutorial](https://github.com/dreadnip/go-playground).

I'm trying to experiment with web applications and APIs in Go. On the look-at list:

* Native routing
* Gorilla (Mux) routing
* Native templates
* Third party templating engines
* Middleware
* Auth, crypto
* Static pages
* Golang CMSes?
* Logging
* Database interaction: MySQL, SQLite, Redis

I'm quite font of my Slim/Twig/Sqlite stack in PHP so I'm trying to look at similar things in Go I guess.
